Welcome to Subworld Toolkit!

This mod contains useful settings for developers that want to set up subworlds using the Subworld Library mod.
Subworld Toolkit aims to add a lot of easy to configure settings for subworlds without having to manually add vanilla code to your subworld.

Hooks from ModSystem, GlobalNPC, GlobalTile and GlobalPeojectile are passed into the 'ExtendedSubworld' object for easy access. 
This way you don't have to make multiple objects for each subworld.

Simply reference this mod, add the .dll file as dependency and extend the 'ExtendedSubworld' object.
Check the github repository for the current features/settings.

If you're missing certain features please let me know!

Good luck, Rhoenicx.
